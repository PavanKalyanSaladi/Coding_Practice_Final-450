An array is a collection of objects that similar to one type of objects.
Like Books, Clothes, Pens, Shoes.

Each object/element is next to each other called as contiguous.
Each element of an array has a unique index.

Why array???
If you want to store 3 integer, we can do as follows:
number1
number2
number3

what if you want to store 500 integers? then we use array to store them.
We can access them by using indexing.

Types of Array:-
1. One Dimensional Array
2. Multi Dimensional Array

1. One Dimensional Array: an array with a bunch of values declared in a singl row.
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    arr[0] -> 1

2. Multi Dimensional Array: an array with a bunch of values declared with 
                            double/triple/multiple index.
    arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    arr[1][2] -> 6  (2D Array)

    arr = [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[9, 10], [11, 12]]]
    arr[0][1][1] -> 3
