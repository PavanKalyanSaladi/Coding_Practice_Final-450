Data Structure:- It is used to store the data in a structured way.

Algorithm:- Set of rules for a computer to accomplish the task.
            - Correctness
            - Efficiency

Why DS & Algo:- Input -> Operation -> Output
            - Problem Solving skills
            - Thinking ability in limited time

Types of DS:-
    1. Primitive:-
        1. Integer
        2. Float
        3. String
        4. Boolean
    2. Non Primitive:-
        1. Linear:-
            1. List
            2. Tuple
            3. Array
            4. Linked List
            5. Stack
            6. Queue
        2. Non Linear:-
            1. Set
            2. Dictionary
            3. Tree
            4. Graph

Types of Algorithms:-
    1. Sorting:- To sort the data in ascending or descending order.
    2. Search:- TO find a specific value in a data.
    3. Graph:- To work with data that can be represented as graph.
    4. Dynamic Programming:- To solve problems by breaking them into sub-problems.
    5. Divide and Conquer:- To solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub
                            problems, solving each sub-problem independently, and 
                            then combining the results.
    6. Recursive:- To solve problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems
                    that are similar in nature.
